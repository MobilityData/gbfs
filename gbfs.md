## Introduction

This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

* Provide the status of the system at this moment
* Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

The specification supports real-time travel advice in GBFS-consuming applications.

## Term Definitions

This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.

* JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp)
* Field - In JSON, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp)
* GeoJSON - GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. (https://geojson.org/)
* REQUIRED - The field MUST be included in the dataset, and a value MUST be provided in that field for each record.
* OPTIONAL - The field MAY be omitted from the dataset. If an OPTIONAL column is included, some of the entries in that field MAY be empty strings. An omitted field is equivalent to a field that is empty.
* Conditionally REQUIRED - The field or file is REQUIRED under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is OPTIONAL.

## Files

File Name | REQUIRED | Defines
---|---|---
gbfs.json | Yes <br/>*(as of v2.0)* | Auto-discovery file that links to the other files published for the system. To avoid circular references this file MUST NOT contain links to `manifest.json`.
manifest.json *(added in v3.0-RC)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Required of any GBFS dataset provider that publishes more than one GBFS dataset. For example, if you publish one set of files for Berlin and a different set for Paris, this file is REQUIRED. A discovery file containing a comprehensive list of `gbfs.json` URLs for all GBFS datasets published by the provider.
gbfs_versions.json | OPTIONAL | Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation.
system_information.json | Yes | Details including system operator, system location, year implemented, URL, contact info, time zone.
vehicle_types.json <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Describes the types of vehicles that System operator has available for rent. REQUIRED of systems that include information about vehicle types in the `vehicle_status` file. If this file is not included, then all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles.
station_information.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | List of all stations, their capacities and locations. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks.
station_status.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | Number of available vehicles and docks at each station and station availability. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks.
vehicle_status.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | *(as of v2.1)* Describes all vehicles that are not currently in active rental. REQUIRED for free floating (dockless) vehicles. OPTIONAL for station based (docked) vehicles. Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT appear in this feed.
system_hours.json | - | This file is deprecated *(as of v3.0-RC)*. See `system_information.opening_hours` for system hours of operation.
system_calendar.json | - | This file is deprecated *(as of v3.0-RC)*. See `system_information.opening_hours` for system dates of operation.
system_regions.json | OPTIONAL | Regions the system is broken up into.
system_pricing_plans.json | OPTIONAL | System pricing scheme.
system_alerts.json | OPTIONAL | Current system alerts.
geofencing_zones.json <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | OPTIONAL | Geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes.

## Accessibility

Datasets SHOULD be published at an easily accessible, public, permanent URL. (for example, https://www.example.com/gbfs/v3/gbfs.json). The URL SHOULD be directly available without requiring login to access the file to facilitate download by consuming software applications.

To be compliant with GBFS, all systems MUST have an entry in the [systems.csv](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) file.

### Feed Availability

Automated tools for application performance monitoring SHOULD be used to ensure feed availability.
Producers MUST provide a technical contact who can respond to feed outages in the `feed_contact_email` field in the `system_information.json` file.

### Seasonal Shutdowns, Disruptions of Service

Feeds SHOULD continue to be published during seasonal or temporary shutdowns.  Feed URLs SHOULD NOT return a 404.  An empty vehicles array SHOULD be returned by `vehicle_status.json`. Stations in `station_status.json` SHOULD be set to `is_renting:false`, `is_returning:false` and `is_installed:false` where applicable. Seasonal shutdown dates SHOULD be reflected using `opening_hours` in `system_information.json`.

Announcements for disruptions of service, including disabled stations or temporary closures of stations or systems SHOULD be made in `system_alerts.json`.

###  Hours and Dates of Operation
Beginning with v3.0-RC, hours and dates of operation are described using the Open Street Map [opening_hours](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) format. The OSM opening_hours syntax is quite complex, therefore it is RECOMMENDED that publishers validate their opening_hours data to ensure its accuracy.
* [OSM opening_hours examples](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours)
* [OSM opening_hours syntax guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours/specification)
* [OSM opening_hours validation tool](https://openingh.openstreetmap.de/evaluation_tool/)
* [OSM opening_hours project and code libraries](https://github.com/opening-hours)

Hours and dates of operation SHOULD be published even in cases where services are continuously available 24/7. During periods when a system or station is outside of opening hours, stations SHOULD be set to `is_renting = false`. During these periods, `station_status.json.num_vehicles_available` and `station_status.json.num_docks_available` SHOULD reflect the number of vehicles and docks that would be available if the system or station were open. The `vehicles` array in `vehicle_status` SHOULD reflect those vehicles that are in the field and accessible to users that would be available for rental if the system were open.

## File Requirements

* All files MUST be valid JSON
* All files in the spec MAY be published at a URL path or with an alternate name (e.g., `station_info` instead of `station_information.json`) *(as of v2.0)*.
* All data MUST be UTF-8 encoded    
* All deep links MUST use HTTPS
* Line breaks MUST be represented by unix newline characters only (\n)
* Pagination is not supported.

### File Distribution

* Files are distributed as individual HTTP endpoints.
    * All endpoints MUST use HTTPS
    * REQUIRED files MUST NOT 404. They MUST return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in [Output Format](#output-format).
    * OPTIONAL files MAY 404. A 404 of an OPTIONAL file SHOULD NOT be considered an error.

### Version Endpoints

The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the `version` field in all files. See [Output Format](#output-format). All endpoints within a data set SHOULD conform to the same MAJOR or MINOR version. Mixing of versions within data sets is NOT RECOMMENDED.<br />

GBFS documentation will include a list of current and past supported MAJOR and MINOR versions. Supported versions SHALL NOT span more than two MAJOR versions. Past versions with _Supported_ status MAY be patched to correct bugs or vulnerabilities, but new features will not be introduced. Past versions with _Deprecated_ status will not be patched, and their use SHOULD be discontinued. Producers SHOULD continue to maintain existing feeds while they have _Supported_ status.

GBFS producers SHOULD provide endpoints that conform to the current MAJOR version release within 180 days of a new MAJOR version release. It is not necessary to support more than one MINOR release of the same MAJOR release group, because MINOR releases are backwards-compatible. See [Specification Versioning](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#specification-versioning).

### Auto-Discovery

Publishers SHOULD implement auto-discovery of GBFS feeds by linking to the location of the `gbfs.json` auto-discovery endpoint.

* The location of the auto-discovery file SHOULD be provided in the HTML area of the shared mobility landing page hosted at the URL specified in the `url` field of the `system_information.json` file.
* This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
    * `<link rel="gbfs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json" />`
    * References:
      * https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
      * https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used
* A shared mobility landing page MAY contain links to auto-discovery files for multiple systems.

### Localization

* Each supported language MUST be listed in the `languages` field in `system_information.json`. *(as of v3.0-RC)*
* Translations MUST be provided for each supported language for all translateable fields of type Array&lt;[Localized String](#localized-string)&gt;. *(as of v3.0-RC)*
* URLs pointing to text intended for consumption by end-users MUST be provided for each supported language. *(as of v3.0-RC)*

### Text Fields and Naming

Rich text SHOULD NOT be stored in free form text fields. Fields SHOULD NOT contain HTML.

All customer-facing text strings (including station names) SHOULD use Mixed Case (not ALL CAPS), following local conventions for capitalization of place names on displays capable of displaying lower case characters.

   * Examples:
     * Central Park South
     * Villiers-sur-Marne
     * Market Street

Abbreviations SHOULD NOT be used for names and other text (for example, St. for Street), unless a location is called by its abbreviated name (for example, “JFK Airport”). Abbreviations may be problematic for accessibility by screen reader software and voice user interfaces. Consuming software can be engineered to reliably convert full words to abbreviations for display, but converting from abbreviations to full words is prone to more risk of error.

Names used for stations, virtual stations, and geofenced areas SHOULD be human-readable. Naming conventions used for locations SHOULD consider a variety of use cases including both text and maps.

Descriptions SHOULD NOT include information so specific that it could be used in tracking of vehicles or trips.

### Coordinate Precision

Feeds SHOULD provide 6 digits (0.000001) of precision for decimal degrees lat/lon coordinates.

Decimal places | Degrees | Distance at the Equator
---|---|---
0|1.0|111 km
1|0.1|11.1 km
2|0.01|1.11 km
3|0.001|111 m
4|0.0001|11.1 m
5|0.00001|1.11 m
**6**|**0.000001**|**0.11 m**
7|0.0000001|1.11 cm

### Data Latency

The data returned by the near-realtime endpoints `station_status.json` and `vehicle_status.json` SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date.  Appropriate values SHOULD be set using the `ttl` property for each endpoint based on how often the data in feeds are refreshed or updated. For near-realtime endpoints where the data should always be refreshed, the `ttl` value SHOULD be `0`. The `last_updated` timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. The `last_reported` timestamp represents the last time a station or vehicle reported its status to the operator's backend.

## Licensing

It is RECOMMENDED that all GBFS data sets be offered under an open data license. Open data licenses allow consumers to freely use, modify, and share GBFS data for any purpose in perpetuity. Licensing of GBFS data provides certainty to GBFS consumers, allowing them to integrate GBFS data into their work. All GBFS data sets SHOULD specify a license using the `license_id` field with an [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) or by using the `license_url` field with a URL pointing to a custom license in `system_information.json`. See the GBFS repo for a [comparison of a subset of standard licenses](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/data-licenses.md).

### Extensions Outside of the Specification

To accommodate the needs of feed producers and consumers prior to the adoption of a change, additional fields can be added to feeds even if these fields are not part of the official specification. Custom extensions that may provide value to the GBFS community and align with the [GBFS Guiding Principles](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#guiding-principles) SHOULD be proposed for inclusion in the specification through the change process. Extreme caution is advised to avoid introducing extensions which may be used to track the movements of vehicles or their users.

Field names of extensions SHOULD be prefixed with an underscore ( _ ) character. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that these additional fields be documented on the [wiki](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/wiki) page of the GBFS repository in this format:

Submitted by | Field Name | File Name | Defines
---|---|---|---
Publisher's name|_field_name|Name of GBFS endpoint where field is used|Description of purpose of use

## JSON Files

### Output Format

Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object:

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`last_updated` | Yes | Timestamp | Indicates the last time data in the feed was updated. This timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time.
`ttl` | Yes | Non-negative integer | Number of seconds before the data in the feed will be updated again (0 if the data should always be refreshed).
`version` | Yes | String | GBFS version number to which the feed conforms, according to the versioning framework.
`data` | Yes | Object | Response data in the form of name:value pairs.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "last_updated": 1640887163,
  "ttl": 3600,
  "version": "3.0-RC",
  "data": {
    "name": "Example Bike Rental",
    "system_id": "example_cityname",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago",
    "languages": ["en"]
  }
}
```

### gbfs.json

The `gbfs.json` discovery file SHOULD represent a single system or geographic area in which vehicles are operated. The location (URL) of the `gbfs.json` file SHOULD be made available to the public using the specification’s [auto-discovery](#auto-discovery) function. To avoild circular references, this file MUST NOT contain links to `manifest.json` files.*(as of v3.0-RC)* <br />The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`feeds` | Yes | Array | An array of all of the feeds that are published by this auto-discovery file. Each element in the array is an object with the keys below.
\-&nbsp; `name` | Yes | String | Key identifying the type of feed this is. The key MUST be the base file name defined in the spec for the corresponding feed type ( `system_information` for `system_information.json` file, `station_information` for `station_information.json` file).
\-&nbsp; `url` | Yes | URL | URL for the feed. Note that the actual feed endpoints (urls) may not be defined in the `file_name.json` format. For example, a valid feed endpoint could end with `station_info` instead of `station_information.json`.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "last_updated": 1640887163,
  "ttl": 0,
  "version": "3.0-RC",
  "data": {
    "feeds": [

### system_information.json

The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`system_id` | Yes | ID | This is a globally unique identifier for the vehicle share system. Each distinct system or geographic area in which vehicles are operated MUST have its own unique `system_id`. It is up to the publisher of the feed to guarantee uniqueness and MUST be checked against existing `system_id` fields in  [systems.csv](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) to ensure this. This value is intended to remain the same over the life of the system. <br><br> System IDs SHOULD be recognizable as belonging to a particular system as opposed to random strings - for example, `bcycle_austin` or `biketown_pdx`.
`languages` <br/>*(added of v3.0-RC)* | Yes | Array | List of languages used in translated strings. Each element in the list must be of type Language.
`name` <br/>*(as of v3.0-RC)* | Yes | Array&lt;Localized String&gt; | Name of the system to be displayed to customers.

### station_status.json

Describes the capacity and rental availability of a station. Data returned SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date.  See [Data Latency](#data-latency). Data reflects the operator's most recent knowledge of the station’s status. Any station that is represented in `station_status.json` MUST have a corresponding entry in `station_information.json`.<br/>The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`stations` | Yes | Array | Array that contains one object per station in the system as defined below.
\-&nbsp;`station_id` | Yes | ID | Identifier of a station. See [station_information.json](#station_informationjson).
\-&nbsp;`num_vehicles_available` | Yes | Non-negative integer | Number of functional vehicles physically at the station that may be offered for rental. To know if the vehicles are available for rental, see `is_renting`. <br/><br/>If `is_renting` = `true` this is the number of vehicles that are currently available for rent. If `is_renting` =`false` this is the number of vehicles that would be available for rent if the station were set to allow rentals.
\- `vehicle_types_available` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Array | REQUIRED if the [vehicle_types.json](#vehicle_typesjson) file has been defined. This field's value is an array of objects. Each of these objects is used to model the total number of each defined vehicle type available at a station. The total number of vehicles from each of these objects SHOULD add up to match the value specified in the `num_vehicles_available`  field.
&emsp;\- `vehicle_type_id` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Yes | ID | The `vehicle_type_id` of each vehicle type at the station as described in [vehicle_types.json](#vehicle_typesjson). This field is REQUIRED if the [vehicle_types.json](#vehicle_typesjson) is defined.
&emsp;\- `count` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Yes | Non-negative integer | A number representing the total number of available vehicles of the corresponding `vehicle_type_id` as defined in [vehicle_types.json](#vehicle_typesjson) at the station.
\-&nbsp;`num_vehicles_disabled` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative integer | Number of disabled vehicles of any type at the station. Vendors who do not want to publicize the number of disabled vehicles or docks in their system can opt to omit station `capacity` (in [station_information.json](#station_informationjson), `num_vehicles_disabled`, and `num_docks_disabled` *(as of v2.0)*. If station `capacity` is published, then broken docks/vehicles can be inferred (though not specifically whether the decreased capacity is a broken vehicle or dock).
\-&nbsp;`num_docks_available` | Conditionally REQUIRED <br/>*(as of v2.0)* | Non-negative integer | REQUIRED except for stations that have unlimited docking capacity (e.g. virtual stations) *(as of v2.0)*. Number of functional docks physically at the station that are able to accept vehicles for return. To know if the docks are accepting vehicle returns, see `is_returning`. <br /><br/> If `is_returning` = `true` this is the number of docks that are currently available to accept vehicle returns. If `is_returning` = `false` this is the number of docks that would be available if the station were set to allow returns.
\- `vehicle_docks_available` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Array | This field is REQUIRED in feeds where the [vehicle_types.json](#vehicle_typesjson) is defined and where certain docks are only able to accept certain vehicle types. If every dock at the station is able to accept any vehicle type, then this field is not REQUIRED. This field's value is an array of objects. Each of these objects is used to model the number of docks available for certain vehicle types. The total number of docks from each of these objects SHOULD add up to match the value specified in the `num_docks_available` field.
&emsp;\- `vehicle_type_ids` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Array | REQUIRED if `vehicle_docks_available` is defined. An array of strings where each string represents a `vehicle_type_id` that is able to use a particular type of dock at the station
&emsp;\- `count` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Non-negative integer | REQUIRED if `vehicle_docks_available` is defined. A number representing the total number of available vehicles of the corresponding vehicle type as defined in the `vehicle_types` array at the station that can accept vehicles of the specified types in the `vehicle_types` array.
\-&nbsp;`num_docks_disabled` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative integer | Number of disabled dock points at the station.
\-&nbsp;`is_installed` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station currently on the street?<br/><br/>`true` - Station is installed on the street.<br/>`false` - Station is not installed on the street.<br/><br/>Boolean SHOULD be set to `true` when equipment is present on the street. In seasonal systems where equipment is removed during winter, boolean SHOULD be set to `false` during the off season. May also be set to false to indicate planned (future) stations which have not yet been installed.
\-&nbsp;`is_renting` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station currently renting vehicles? <br /><br />`true` - Station is renting vehicles. Even if the station is empty, if it would otherwise allow rentals, this value MUST be `true`.<br/>`false` - Station is not renting vehicles.<br/><br/>If the station is temporarily taken out of service and not allowing rentals, this field MUST be set to `false`.<br/><br/>If a station becomes inaccessible to users due to road construction or other factors this field SHOULD be set to `false`. Field SHOULD be set to `false` during hours or days when the system is not offering vehicles for rent.
\-&nbsp;`is_returning` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station accepting vehicle returns? <br /><br />`true` - Station is accepting vehicle returns. Even if the station is full, if it would otherwise allow vehicle returns, this value MUST be `true`.<br /> `false` - Station is not accepting vehicle returns.<br/><br/>If the station is temporarily taken out of service and not allowing vehicle returns, this field MUST be set to `false`.<br/><br/>If a station becomes inaccessible to users due to road construction or other factors, this field SHOULD be set to `false`.
\-&nbsp;`last_reported` | Yes | Timestamp | The last time this station reported its status to the operator's backend.

### vehicle_status.json
*(as of v3.0-RC, formerly free_bike_status)*
*(as of v2.1)* Describes all vehicles that are not currently in active rental. REQUIRED for free floating (dockless) vehicles. OPTIONAL for station based (docked) vehicles. Data returned SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date.  See [Data Latency](#data-latency). Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT appear in this feed. Vehicles listed as available for rental MUST be in the field and accessible to users. Vehicles that are not accessible (for example, in a warehouse or in transit) MUST NOT appear as available for rental.<br/>The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the `system_calendar.json` feed.<br />
Obsolete alerts SHOULD be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. <br/>The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`alerts` | Yes | Array | Array of objects each indicating a system alert as defined below.
\-&nbsp;`alert_id` | Yes | ID | Identifier for this alert.
\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | Enum | Valid values are:<br /><br /><ul><li>`system_closure`</li><li>`station_closure`</li><li>`station_move`</li><li>`other`</li></ul>
\-&nbsp;`times` | OPTIONAL | Array | Array of objects with the fields `start` and `end` indicating when the alert is in effect (for example, when the system or station is actually closed, or when a station is scheduled to be moved).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`start` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Timestamp | REQUIRED if `times` array is defined. Start time of the alert.
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`end` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | End time of the alert. If there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this can be omitted.
\-&nbsp;`station_ids` | OPTIONAL | Array | If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ID(s). Otherwise omit this field. If both `station_id` and `region_id` are omitted, this alert affects the entire system.
\-&nbsp;`region_ids` | OPTIONAL | Array | If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ID(s). Otherwise, omit this field. If both `station_id`s and `region_id`s are omitted, this alert affects the entire system.
\-&nbsp; `url` <br/>*(as of v3.0-RC)* | OPTIONAL | Array&lt;Localized String&gt; | URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert.
\-&nbsp; `summary` <br/>*(as of v3.0-RC)*  | Yes | Array&lt;Localized String&gt; | A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer.
\-&nbsp; `description` <br/>*(as of v3.0-RC)*  | OPTIONAL | Array&lt;Localized String&gt; | Detailed description of the alert.
\-&nbsp;`last_updated` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | Indicates the last time the info for the alert was updated.

**Example:**

### geofencing_zones.json

*(added in v2.1)*

Describes geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes. Geofenced areas are delineated using GeoJSON in accordance with [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946).

When `geofencing_zones.json` is defined, the `global_rules` field determines the default ride restrictions for all areas not explicitly covered by a geofence zones and its associated rules.  See [Geofencing Rule Precedence](#geofencing-rule-precedence) for more details.  When `geofencing_zones.json` is not defined, then no such ride restrictions apply.

Geofences and GPS operate in two dimensions. Restrictions placed on an overpass or bridge will also  be applied to the roadway or path beneath.<br><br>Care SHOULD be taken when developing geofence based policies that rely on location data.  Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater.  This may result in vehicles being placed within a geofenced zone when they are actually outside or adjacent to the zone. Transit time between server and client can also impact when a user is notified of a geofence based policy. A vehicle traveling at 15kph can be well inside of a restricted zone before a notification is received.

The following fields are all attributes within the main `data` object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`geofencing_zones` | Yes | GeoJSON FeatureCollection | Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows.
\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | String | “FeatureCollection” (as per IETF [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3)).
\-&nbsp;`features` | Yes | Array | Array of objects as defined below.
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | String | “Feature” (as per IETF [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3)).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`geometry` | Yes | GeoJSON MultiPolygon | A polygon that describes where rides may or may not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations or affordances. Rules may only apply to the interior of a polygon. All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (meaning they can be displayed on a map for public use).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`properties` | Yes | Object | Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations.
&emsp; &emsp; \-&nbsp; `name` <br/>*(as of v3.0-RC)*  | OPTIONAL | Array&lt;Localized String&gt; | Public name of the geofencing zone.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`start` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`end` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`rules` | OPTIONAL | Array&lt;[Rule](#geofencing-rule-object)&gt; | Array of [Rule](#geofencing-rule-object) objects defining restrictions that apply within the area of the polygon.  See [Geofencing Rule Precedence](#geofencing-rule-precedence) for details on semantics of overlapping polygons, vehicle types, and other precedence rules.
`global_rules` | Yes | Array&lt;[Rule](#geofencing-rule-object)&gt; | Array of [Rule](#geofencing-rule-object) objects defining restrictions that apply globally in all areas as the default restrictions, except where overridden with an explicit geofencing zone.  See [Geofencing Rule Precedence](#geofencing-rule-precedence) for more details.<br/<br/>A rule or list of rules, as appropriate, must be specified in the global rules list covering all vehicle types in the feed.

#### Geofencing Rule Object

A `Rule` object defines the set of restrictions in place for a particular zone.  `Rule` objects are used as a value type in multiple places in `geofencing_zones.json`.  A `Rule` object has the following fields:

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`vehicle_type_id` | OPTIONAL | Array | Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in `vehicle_types.json`). If vehicle type IDs are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types.
`ride_start_allowed` | REQUIRED | Boolean | Is the ride allowed to start in this zone? <br /><br /> `true` - Ride can start in this zone. <br /> `false` - Ride cannot start in this zone.
`ride_end_allowed` | REQUIRED | Boolean | Is the ride allowed to end in this zone? <br /><br /> `true` - Ride can end in this zone. <br /> `false` - Ride cannot end in this zone.
`ride_through_allowed` | REQUIRED | Boolean | Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? <br /><br /> `true` - Ride can travel through this zone. <br /> `false` - Ride cannot travel through this zone.
`maximum_speed_kph` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative Integer | What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? <br /><br /> If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.
`station_parking`<br/>*(added in v2.3)* | OPTIONAL | Boolean | Can vehicles only be parked at stations defined in `station_information.json` within this geofence zone? <br /><br />`true` - Vehicles can only be parked at stations.  <br /> `false` - Vehicles may be parked outside of stations.

#### Geofencing Rule Precedence

Geofencing [Rule](#geofencing-rule-object) objects are specified within arrays for the `rules` and `global_rules` fields of `geofencing_zones.json` to allow for different restrictions for different vehicle types.  When multiple rules in the same array apply to a particular vehicle type, per the semantics of the `vehicle_type_id` field, then the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence for that vehicle type.

When multiple overlapping polygons define rules that apply to a particular vehicle type, then the rules from the earlier polygon (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence for that vehicle type in the overlapping area.  Polygons with inactive time ranges should be excluded from consideration when considering precedence.

When a polygon and the `global_rules` field define rules that apply to a particular vehicle type, then the rules from the polygon take precedence for that vehicle type in the area of the polygon.

See examples below.

##### Polygon Overlap Examples

The following polygon diagram will be used in a number of examples below of geofencing rule resolution.

![Geofencing Example Diagram with two overlapping polygons A and B, and areas a, b, and ab.](images/geofencing_example.svg)

In the examples below, only a minimal set of fields are specified for clarity.

##### Partially Overlapping Polygons with Same Vehicle Types

```json
"geofencing_zones.features": [
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon A ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["bike"],
          "ride_through_allowed": true
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon B ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["bike"],
          "ride_through_allowed": false,
          "maximum_speed_kph": 20
        }
      ]
    }
  }
],
"global_rules": [
  {
    "vehicle_type_id": ["bike"],
    "ride_through_allowed": false,
    "maximum_speed_kph": 10
  }
]
```
 
Both polygons specify rules for vehicle type `bike`.  In addition, there is a global rule for `bike` as well.  For `ride_through_allowed`, which is defined in both polygons, polygon A takes precedence over polygon B in area `ab` because it appears earlier in the JSON.  For `maximum_speed_kph`, only polygon B specifies a rule for this restriction, so it is used for area `ab`, despite the presence of polygon A.  For the remainder of polygon A in area `a`, the speed defaults to the global rule.


Area | Vehicle Type | ride_through_allowed | maximum_speed_kph
---|------|-------|----------
a  | bike | true  | 10
ab | bike | true  | 20 
b  | bike | false | 20
g  | bike | false | 10


##### Partially Overlapping Polygons with Different Vehicle Types

```json
"geofencing_zones.features": [
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon A ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["bike"],
          "ride_through_allowed": true
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon B ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["scooter"],
          "ride_through_allowed": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
],
"global_rules": [
  {
    "vehicle_type_id": ["bike"],
    "ride_through_allowed": false
  },
  {
    "vehicle_type_id": ["scooter"],
    "ride_through_allowed": true
  }
]
``` 

Though polygon A appears earlier in the file than polygon B, polygon A does not mention vehicle type `scooter`, so it is not considered when determining applicable rules for area `ab` for scooters.

Area | Vehicle Type | ride_through_allowed
---|---------|-------
a  | bike    | true
ab | bike    | true
b  | bike    | false
g  | bike    | false
a  | scooter | true
ab | scooter | false
b  | scooter | false
g  | scooter | true


##### Partially Overlapping Polygons with Some Overlapping Vehicle Types

```json
"geofencing_zones.features": [
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon A ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["bike", "scooter"],
          "ride_through_allowed": true
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "geometry": { "#": "... Polygon B ..." },
    "properties": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "vehicle_type_id": ["scooter"],
          "ride_through_allowed": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
],
"global_rules": [
  {
    "ride_through_allowed": false
  }
]
```

For vehicle type `scooter`, polygon A takes precedence over Polygon B in area `ab` because it appears earlier in the JSON.

Area | Vehicle Type | ride_through_allowed
---|---------|-------
a  | bike    | true
ab | bike    | true
b  | bike    | false
g  | bike    | false
a  | scooter | fales
ab | scooter | true
b  | scooter | false
g  | scooter | false

## Deep Links

Deep links to iOS, Android, and web apps are supported via URIs in the `system_information.json`, `station_information.json`, and `vehicle_status.json` files. The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples. For further examples, see ["What's New in GBFS"](https://medium.com/@mobilitydata/whats-new-in-gbfs-v2-0-63eb46e6bdc4).

### Analytics

In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link request to a rental app by appending the `client_id` parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app.

For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append:

`client_id=google.com`

...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is:

`com.example.android://open.example.app/stations?id=1234567890`

...then the URI used by Google would be: `com.example.android://open.example.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com`

Other supported parameters include:

1. `ad_id`  - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (for example, IFDA on iOS)
2. `token`  - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app.

#### Deep links Examples 

**Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported:**

***system_information.json***

```json
{
  "last_updated": 1640887163,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0-RC",
  "data": {

    "rental_apps": {
      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.android://"
      },
      "ios": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.ios://"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

***station_information.json***

```json
{
  "last_updated": 1640887163,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0-RC",
  "data": {
    "stations": [
      {
        "station_id": "425",
        "name": "Coppertail",
        "lat": 27.956333,
        "lon": -82.430436,
        "rental_uris": {
          "android": "https://www.example.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android",
          "ios": "https://www.example.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that the Android URI and iOS Universal Link URLs do not necessarily use the same identifier as the `station_id`.

**Example 2 - App Links are not supported on Android and Universal Links are not supported on iOS, but deep links are still supported on Android and iOS:**

***system_information.json***

```json

      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.android://",
        "store_uri": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.android"
      },
      "ios": {
        "store_uri": "https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id123456789",
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.ios://"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

***station_information.json***

```json

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example 3 - Deep link web URLs are supported, but not Android or iOS native apps:**
