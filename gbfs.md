## Introduction
This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

* Provide the status of the system at this moment
* Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

Historical data, including station details and ride data is to be provided by a more compact specification designed specifically for such archival purposes. The data in the specification contained in this document is intended for consumption by clients intending to provide real-time (or semi-real-time) transit advice and is designed as such.

## Version endpoints
The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the `version` field in all files. See [Output Format](#output-format).

GBFS Best Practice defines that:

_GBFS producers_ should provide endpoints that conform to both the current specification long term support (LTS) branch as well as the latest release branch within at least 3 months of a new spec `MAJOR` or `MINOR` version release. It is not necessary to support more than one `MINOR` release of the same `MAJOR` release group because `MINOR` releases are backwards-compatible. See [specification versioning](README.md#specification-versioning)

_GBFS consumers_ should, at a minumum, support the current LTS branch. It highly recommended that GBFS consumers support later releases.

Default GBFS feed URLs, e.g. `https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json` or `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json` must direct consumers to the feed that conforms to the current LTS documentation branch.


## Files
This specification defines the following files along with their associated content:

File Name                   | Required                |       Defines
--------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------
gbfs.json                   | Optional                | Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system. This file is optional, but highly recommended.
gbfs_versions.json          | Optional                | Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation.
system_information.json     | Yes                     | Describes the system including System operator, System location, year implemented, URLs, contact info, time zone
station_information.json    | Conditionally required  | Mostly static list of all stations, their capacities and locations. Required of systems utilizing docks.
station_status.json         | Conditionally required  | Number of available bikes and docks at each station and station availability. Required of systems utilizing docks.
free_bike_status.json       | Conditionally required  | Describes bikes that are available for rent. Required of systems that don't utilize docks or offer bikes for rent outside of stations.
system_hours.json           | Optional                | Describes the hours of operation for the system
system_calendar.json        | Optional                | Describes the days of operation for the system
system_regions.json         | Optional                | Describes the regions the system is broken up into
system_pricing_plans.json   | Optional                | Describes the system pricing
system_alerts.json          | Optional                | Describes current system alerts

## File Requirements
* All files should be valid JSON
* All data should be UTF-8 encoded
* Line breaks should be represented by unix newline characters only (\n)
* All URIs must be a fully qualified URI that includes the scheme (e.g., http:// or https://), and any special characters in the URI must be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URI values.

### File Distribution
* This specification does not dictate the implementation details around the distribution of the JSON data files
* If the publisher intends to distribute as individual HTTP endpoints then:
    * Required files must not 404 - they should return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in Output Format
    * Optional files may 404 - a 404 of an optional file should not be considered an error, it just indicates that the publisher has chosen not to publish this data
* Auto-Discovery:
    * This specification supports auto-discovery
    * The location of the auto-discovery file will be provided in the HTML <head> area of the bikeshare landing page hosted at the URL specified in the url field of the system_infomation.json file
    * This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
      * `<link rel="gbfs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json" />`
    * Reference:
      * https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices#tags
      * https://dev.twitter.com/cards/markup
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used

### Localization

* Each set of data files should be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json
* A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages should do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as
    * https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json
    * https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json

## Field Definitions

* Time stamp fields must be represented as integers in POSIX time (i.e., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC)
* ID fields in the document should be represented as strings that identify that particular object. They:
    * must be unique within like fields (bike_id must be unique among bikes)
    * do not have to be globally unique
    * must not contain spaces
    * should be persistent for a given object (station, plan, etc)
* Text fields can only contain text - they must not contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines
* Enumerable values should be expected to change over time. Values will not be removed, but new valid values may be added as business requirements change and consumers should be designed to handle these changes

### Output Format
Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object:

Please use Android App Links (https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) if possible so viewing apps don’t need to manually manage the redirect of the user to the app store if the user doesn’t have the application installed. <br><br>This URI should be a deep link specific to this station, and should not be a general rental page that includes information for more than one station. The deep link should take users directly to this station, without any prompts, interstitial pages, or logins. Make sure that users can see this station even if they never previously opened the application.  <br><br>If this field is empty, it means deep linking isn’t supported in the native Android rental app. <br><br>Note that URIs do not necessarily include the station_id for this station - other identifiers can be used by the rental app within the URI to uniquely identify this station. <br><br>See the [Analytics](#Analytics) section for how viewing apps can report the origin of the deep link to rental apps. <br><br>Android App Links example value: `https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android` <br><br>Deep Link (without App Links) example value: `com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890`

The deep link should take users directly to this station, without any prompts, interstitial pages, or logins. Make sure that users can see this station even if they never previously opened the application.  <br><br>If this field is empty, it means deep linking isn’t supported in the native iOS rental app. <br><br>Note that the URI does not necessarily include the station_id - other identifiers can be used by the rental app within the URL to uniquely identify this station. <br><br>See the [Analytics](#Analytics) section for how viewing apps can report the origin of the deep link to rental apps. <br><br>iOS Universal Links example value: `https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios` <br><br>Deep Link (without Universal Links) example value: `com.abcrental.ios://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890`

This is intended to be a human-readable description and should not be used for automatic calculations

### system_alerts.json
This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system_calendar.json feed.

This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. The consumer could use the start/end information to determine if this is a past, ongoing or future alert and adjust the presentation accordingly.

\-&nbsp;times           | Optional    | Array of hashes with the keys "start" and "end" indicating when the alert is in effect (e.g. when the system or station is actually closed, or when it is scheduled to be moved). If this array is omitted then the alert should be displayed as long as it is in the feed.
&emsp;\-&nbsp;start     | Yes         | Integer POSIX timestamp - required if container "times" key is present
&emsp;\-&nbsp;end       | Optional    | Integer POSIX timestamp - if there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this key can be omitted indicating that there is no currently scheduled end time for the alert
\-&nbsp;station_ids     | Optional    | Array of strings - If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ids, otherwise omit this field. If both station_ids and region_ids are omitted, assume this alert affects the entire system
\-&nbsp;region_ids      | Optional    | Array of strings - If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ids, otherwise, omit this field. If both station_ids and region_ids are omitted, assume this alert affects the entire system
\-&nbsp;url             | Optional    | String - URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert, if there is one
\-&nbsp;summary         | Yes         | String - A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer
\-&nbsp;description     | Optional    | String - Detailed text description of the alert

## Deep Links *(beta)*

Deep links to iOS, Android, and web apps are supported via URIs in the `system_information.json`, `station_information.json`, and `free_bike_status.json` files. The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples.

### Analytics *(beta)*

In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link to request to a rental app by appending the `client_id` *(beta)* parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app. 

For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append:

`client_id=google.com` 

...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is:

`com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890`

...then the URI used by Google would be: `com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com`

Other supported parameters include:

1. `ad_id` *(beta)* - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (e.g., IFDA on iOS)
2. `token` *(beta)* - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app.

### Examples *(beta)*

#### Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported:

*system_information.json*

```
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "data": {
  "system_id": "1000",
  "short_name": "ABC Bike Rental",
  "rental_apps": {
    "android": {
      "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.android://"
    },
    "ios": {
      "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.ios://"
    }
  }
  ...
```

*station_information.json*

```
"stations": [
  { 
    "station_id": 425,
    "name": "Coppertail",
    "lat": 27.9563335328521,
    "lon": -82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "android": "https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android",
      "ios": "https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios"
    }
  },
  ...
```


Note that the Android URI and iOS Universal Link URLs don’t necessarily use the same identifier as the station_id.


#### Example 2 - App Links are not supported on Android and Universal Links are not supported on iOS, but deep links are still supported on Android and iOS:

*system_information.json*

```
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "data": {
    "system_id": "1000",
    "short_name": "ABC Bike Rental",
    "rental_apps": {
      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.android://"
        "store_uri": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abcrental.android",
      },
      "ios": {
        "store_uri": "https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id123456789",
        "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.ios://"
      }
    },
    ...
```

*station_information.json*

```
"stations": [
  { 
    "station_id": 425,
    "name": "Coppertail",
    "lat": 27.9563335328521,
    "lon": -82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "android": "com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890",
      "ios": "com.abcrental.ios://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890"
    }
  },
  ...
```

#### Example 3 - Deep link web URLs are supported, but not Android or iOS native apps:

*station_information.json*

```
"stations": [ 
  {
    "station_id":425,
    "name":"Coppertail",
    "lat":27.9563335328521,
    "lon":-82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "web":"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890",
    }
  },
  ...
```
