## Introduction

This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

* Provide the status of the system at this moment
* Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

The specification supports real-time travel advice in GBFS-consuming applications.

## Version Endpoints

The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the `version` field in all files. See [Output Format](#output-format).<br />

GBFS Best Practice defines that:<br />

_GBFS producers_ SHOULD provide endpoints that conform to both the current specification long term support (LTS) branch as well as the latest release branch within at least 3 months of a new spec _MAJOR_ or _MINOR_ version release. It is not necessary to support more than one _MINOR_ release of the same _MAJOR_ release group because _MINOR_ releases are backwards-compatible. See [specification versioning](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#specification-versioning)<br />

_GBFS consumers_ SHOULD, at a minimum, support the current LTS branch. It is highly RECOMMENDED that GBFS consumers support later releases.<br />

Default GBFS feed URLs, e.g. `https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json` or `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json` MUST direct consumers to the feed that conforms to the current LTS documentation branch.

## Term Definitions

This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.

* JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp)
* Field - In JSON, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp)
* GeoJSON - GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. (https://geojson.org/)
* REQUIRED - The field MUST be included in the dataset, and a value MUST be provided in that field for each record.
* OPTIONAL - The field MAY be omitted from the dataset. If an OPTIONAL column is included, some of the entries in that field MAY be empty strings. An omitted field is equivalent to a field that is empty.
* Conditionally REQUIRED - The field or file is REQUIRED under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is OPTIONAL.

## Files

File Name | REQUIRED | Defines
---|---|---
gbfs.json | Yes <br/>*(as of v2.0)* | Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system.
gbfs_versions.json <br/>*(added in v1.1)* | OPTIONAL | Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation.
system_information.json | Yes | Details including system operator, system location, year implemented, URL, contact info, time zone.
vehicle_types.json <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | Describes the types of vehicles that System operator has available for rent. REQUIRED of systems that include information about vehicle types in the `free_bike_status` file. If this file is not included, then all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles.
station_information.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | List of all stations, their capacities and locations. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks.
station_status.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | Number of available vehicles and docks at each station and station availability. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks.
free_bike_status.json | Conditionally REQUIRED | *(as of v2.1)* Describes all vehicles that are not currently in active rental. REQUIRED for free floating (dockless) vehicles. OPTIONAL for station based (docked) vehicles. Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT appear in this feed.
system_hours.json | OPTIONAL | Hours of operation for the system.
system_calendar.json | OPTIONAL | Dates of operation for the system.
system_regions.json | OPTIONAL | Regions the system is broken up into.
system_pricing_plans.json | OPTIONAL | System pricing scheme.
system_alerts.json | OPTIONAL | Current system alerts.
geofencing_zones.json <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | OPTIONAL | Geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes.

## Accessibility

Datasets SHOULD be published at an easily accessible, public, permanent URL. (e.g., https://www.example.com/gbfs/v3/gbfs.json). The URL SHOULD be directly available without requiring login to access the file to facilitate download by consuming software applications.

To be compliant with GBFS, all systems MUST have an entry in the [systems.csv](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) file.

### Feed Availability

Automated tools for application performance monitoring SHOULD be used to ensure feed availability.
Producers SHOULD provide a technical contact who can respond to feed outages in the `feed_contact_email` field in the `system_information.json` file.

### Seasonal Shutdowns, Disruptions of Service

Feeds SHOULD continue to be published during seasonal or temporary shutdowns.  Feed URLs SHOULD NOT return a 404.  An empty bikes array SHOULD be returned by `free_bike_status.json`. Stations in `station_status.json` SHOULD be set to `is_renting:false`, `is_returning:false` and `is_installed:false` where applicable. Seasonal shutdown dates SHOULD be reflected in `system_calendar.json`.

Announcements for disruptions of service, including disabled stations or temporary closures of stations or systems SHOULD be made in `system_alerts.json`.

## File Requirements

* All files SHOULD be valid JSON
* All files in the spec MAY be published at a URL path or with an alternate name (e.g., `station_info` instead of `station_information.json`) *(as of v2.0)*.
* All data SHOULD be UTF-8 encoded
* Line breaks SHOULD be represented by unix newline characters only (\n)
* Pagination is not supported.

### File Distribution

* Files are distributed as individual HTTP endpoints.
    * REQUIRED files MUST NOT 404. They MUST return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in [Output Format](#output-format).
    * OPTIONAL files MAY 404. A 404 of an OPTIONAL file SHOULD NOT be considered an error.

### Auto-Discovery

Publishers SHOULD implement auto-discovery of GBFS feeds by linking to the location of the `gbfs.json` auto-discovery endpoint.

* The location of the auto-discovery file SHOULD be provided in the HTML area of the shared mobility landing page hosted at the URL specified in the URL field of the `system_infomation.json` file.
* This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
    * `<link rel="gbfs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json" />`
    * References:
      * https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
      * https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used
* A shared mobility landing page MAY contain links to auto-discovery files for multiple systems.

### Localization

* Each set of data files SHOULD be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json.
* A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages SHOULD do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as:
    * `https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json`
    * `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json`

### Text Fields and Naming

Rich text SHOULD NOT be stored in free form text fields. Fields SHOULD NOT contain HTML.

All customer-facing text strings (including station names) SHOULD use Mixed Case (not ALL CAPS), following local conventions for capitalization of place names on displays capable of displaying lower case characters.

   * Examples:
     * Central Park South
     * Villiers-sur-Marne
     * Market Street

Abbreviations SHOULD NOT be used for names and other text (e.g. St. for Street) unless a location is called by its abbreviated name (e.g. “JFK Airport”). Abbreviations may be problematic for accessibility by screen reader software and voice user interfaces. Consuming software can be engineered to reliably convert full words to abbreviations for display, but converting from abbreviations to full words is prone to more risk of error.

Names used for stations, virtual stations and geofenced areas SHOULD be human readable. Naming conventions used for locations SHOULD consider a variety of use cases including both text and maps.

Descriptions SHOULD NOT include information so specific that it could be used in tracking of vehicles or trips.

### Coordinate Precision

Feeds SHOULD provide 6 digits (0.000001) of precision for decimal degrees lat/lon coordinates.

Decimal places | Degrees | Distance at the Equator
---|---|---
0|1.0|111 km
1|0.1|11.1 km
2|0.01|1.11 km
3|0.001|111 m
4|0.0001|11.1 m
5|0.00001|1.11 m
**6**|**0.000001**|**0.11 m**
7|0.0000001|1.11 cm

### Data Latency

The data returned by the near-realtime endpoints `station_status.json` and `free_bike_status.json` SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date.  Appropriate values SHOULD be set using the `ttl` property for each endpoint based on how often the data in feeds are refreshed or updated. For near-realtime endpoints where the data should always be refreshed the `ttl` value SHOULD be `0`. The`last_updated` timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. The `last_reported` timestamp represents the last time a station or vehicle reported its status to the operator's backend.

## Licensing

It is RECOMMENDED that all GBFS data sets be offered under an open data license. Open data licenses allow consumers to freely use, modify and share GBFS data for any purpose in perpetuity. Licensing of GBFS data provides certainty to GBFS consumers, allowing them to integrate GBFS data into their work. All GBFS data sets SHOULD specify a license using the `license_id` field with an [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) or by using the `license_url` field with a URL pointing to a custom license in `system_information.json`. See the GBFS repo for a [comparison of a subset of standard licenses](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/data-licenses.md).

## Field Types

* Array - A JSON element consisting of an ordered sequence of zero or more values.
* Boolean - One of two possible values, `true`or `false`. Boolean values MUST be JSON booleans, not strings (i.e. `true` or `false`, not `"true"` or `"false"`). *(as of v2.0)*
* Date - A date in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) Complete Date Extended Format: YYYY-MM-DD . Example: `2019-09-13` for September 13th, 2019.
* Email - An email address. Example: `example@example.com`
* Enum (Enumerable values) - An option from a set of predefined constants in the "Defines" column. Enum values SHOULD be lowercase.
Example: The `rental_methods` field contains values `creditcard`, `paypass`, etc...
* Float *(added in v2.1)* - A 32-bit floating point number.
* GeoJSON FeatureCollection - A FeatureCollection as described by the IETF RFC 7946 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3.
* GeoJSON Multipolygon - A Geometry Object as described by the IETF RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.7.
* ID - Should be represented as a string that identifies that particular entity. An ID:
    * MUST be unique within like fields (e.g. `station_id` MUST be unique among stations)
    * does not have to be globally unique, unless otherwise specified
    * MUST NOT contain spaces
    * MUST be persistent for a given entity (station, plan, etc). An exception is floating bike `bike_id`, which MUST NOT be persistent for privacy reasons (see `free_bike_status.json`). *(as of v2.0)*
* Language - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt and https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/. Examples: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English, or `de` for German.
* Latitude - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.
* Longitude - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.
* Non-negative Float - A 32-bit floating point number greater than or equal to 0.
* Non-negative Integer - An integer greater than or equal to 0.
* Object - A JSON element consisting of key-value pairs (fields).
* String - Can only contain text. Strings MUST NOT contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines.
* Time - Service time in the HH:MM:SS format for the time zone indicated in system_information.json (00:00:00 - 47:59:59). Time can stretch up to one additional day in the future to accommodate situations where, for example, a system was open from 11:30pm - 11pm the next day (i.e. 23:30:00-47:00:00).
* Timestamp - Timestamp fields MUST be represented as integers in POSIX time. (e.g., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC)
* Timezone - TZ timezone from the https://www.iana.org/time-zones. Timezone names never contain the space character but MAY contain an underscore. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones for a list of valid values.
Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.
* URI *(added in v1.1)* - A fully qualified URI that includes the scheme (e.g., `com.example.android://`), and any special characters in the URI MUST be correctly escaped. See the following https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URI values. Note that URIs MAY be URLs.
* URL - A fully qualified URL that includes `http://` or `https://`, and any special characters in the URL MUST be correctly escaped. See the following https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.

### Extensions Outside of the Specification

To accommodate the needs of feed producers and consumers prior to the adoption of a change, additional fields can be added to feeds even if these fields are not part of the official specification. Custom extensions that may provide value to the GBFS community and align with the [GBFS Guiding Principles](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#guiding-principles) SHOULD be proposed for inclusion in the specification through the change process.

Field names of extensions SHOULD be prefixed with an underscore ( _) character. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that these additional fields be documented on the [wiki](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/wiki) page of the GBFS repository in this format:

Submitted by | Field Name | File Name | Defines
---|---|---|---
Publisher's name|_field_name|Name of GBFS endpoint where field is used|Description of purpose of use

## JSON Files

### Output Format

Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object:

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines

The following fields are all attributes within the main "data" object for this feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`versions` | Yes | Array | Contains one object, as defined below, for each of the available versions of a feed. The array MUST be sorted by increasing MAJOR and MINOR version number.
\-&nbsp;`version` | Yes | String | The semantic version of the feed in the form `X.Y`.

\-&nbsp;`android` <br/>*(added in v1.1)* | OPTIONAL | Object | Contains rental app download and app discovery information for the Android platform in the `store_uri` and `discovery_uri` fields. See [examples](#examples-added-in-v11) of how to use these fields and [supported analytics](#analytics-added-in-v11).
&emsp;- `store_uri` <br/>*(added in v1.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | URI | URI where the rental Android app can be downloaded from. Typically this will be a URI to an app store such as Google Play. If the URI points to an app store such as Google Play, the URI SHOULD follow Android best practices so the viewing app can directly open the URI to the native app store app instead of a website. <br><br> If a `rental_uris`.`android` field is populated then this field is REQUIRED, otherwise it is OPTIONAL. <br><br>See the [Analytics](#analytics-added-in-v11) section for how viewing apps can report the origin of the deep link to rental apps. <br><br>Example value: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.android`
&emsp;- `discovery_uri` <br/>*(added in v1.1)* | Conditionally REQUIRED | URI | URI that can be used to discover if the rental Android app is installed on the device (e.g., using [`PackageManager.queryIntentActivities()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#queryIntentActivities)). This intent is used by viewing apps to prioritize rental apps for a particular user based on whether they already have a particular rental app installed. <br><br>This field is REQUIRED if a `rental_uris`.`android` field is populated, otherwise it is OPTIONAL. <br><br>Example value: `com.example.android://`

\- `max_range_meters` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Non-negative float | If the vehicle has a motor (as indicated by having a value other than `human` in the `propulsion_type` field), this field is REQUIRED. This represents the furthest distance in meters that the vehicle can travel without recharging or refueling when it has the maximum amount of energy potential (for example, a full battery or full tank of gas).
\- `name` | OPTIONAL | String | The public name of this vehicle type.
\- `vehicle_reserve_time` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative Integer | Maximum time in minutes that a vehicle can be reserved before a rental begins. When a vehicle is reserved by a user the vehicle remains locked until the rental begins. During this time the vehicle is unavailable and cannot be be reserved or rented by other users. The vehicle status in `free_bike_status.json` MUST be set to `is_reserved = true`. If the value of `vehicle_reserve_time` elapses without a rental beginning, the vehicle status MUST change to `is_reserved = false`. If `vehicle_reserve_time` is set to `0` the vehicle type cannot be reserved. 
\- `return_type`<br/>*(added in v2.3-RC)*|| OPTIONAL | Array | The conditions for returning the vehicle at the end of the trip. For vehicles that have more than one return option, include all applicable methods in the array. <br /><br />Current valid values are:<br /><ul><li>`free_floating` _(The vehicle can be returned anywhere permitted within the service area - note that this field is subject to rules in `geofencing_zones.json` if defined.)_</li><li>`roundtrip_station` _(The vehicle must be returned to the initial rental station. Cannot be defined in combination with `free_floating`.)_</li><li>`any_station` _(The vehicle must be returned to any station within the service area - note that a specific station can be defined in [free_bike_status.json](#free_bike_status.json) using `home_station`. Cannot be defined in combination with `roundtrip_station`.)_
\- `vehicle_assets`<br/>*(added in v2.3-RC)*| OPTIONAL | Object | An object where each key defines one of the items listed below.
&emsp;&emsp;\- `icon_url`<br/>*(added in v2.3-RC)*| Conditionally REQUIRED | URL | REQUIRED if `vehicle_assets` is defined. A fully qualified URL pointing to the location of a graphic icon file that MAY be used to represent this vehicle type on maps and in other applications.

A `plan_id` as defined in `system_pricing_plans.json` that identifies a default pricing plan for this vehicle to be used by trip planning applications for purposes of calculating the cost of a single trip using this vehicle type. This default pricing plan is superseded by `pricing_plan_id` when it is defined in `free_bike_status.json` Publishers SHOULD define `default_pricing_plan_id` first and then override it using `pricing_plan_id` in `free_bike_status.json` when necessary.
\- `pricing_plans`<br/>*(added in v2.3-RC)* | OPTIONAL | Array | Array of all pricing plan IDs as defined in `system_pricing_plans.json` that are applied to this vehicle type. <br /><br />This array SHOULD be published when there are multiple pricing plans defined in `system_pricing_plans.json` that apply to a single vehicle type.

Vendors who do not want to publicize the number of disabled vehicles or docks in their system can opt to omit station `capacity` (in [station_information.json](#station_informationjson), `num_bikes_disabled`, and `num_docks_disabled` *(as of v2.0)*. If station `capacity` is published, then broken docks/vehicles can be inferred (though not specifically whether the decreased capacity is a broken vehicle or dock).
\-&nbsp;`num_docks_available` | Conditionally REQUIRED <br/>*(as of v2.0)* | Non-negative integer | REQUIRED except for stations that have unlimited docking capacity (e.g. virtual stations) *(as of v2.0)*. Number of functional docks physically at the station that are able to accept vehicles for return.

&emsp;\- `vehicle_type_ids` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Yes | Array | An array of strings where each string represents a `vehicle_type_id` that is able to use a particular type of dock at the station
&emsp;\- `count` <br/>*(added in v2.1)* | Yes | Non-negative integer | A number representing the total number of available vehicles of the corresponding vehicle type as defined in the `vehicle_types` array at the station that can accept vehicles of the specified types in the `vehicle_types` array.
\-&nbsp;`num_docks_disabled` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative integer | Number of disabled dock points at the station.
\-&nbsp;`is_installed` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station currently on the street?<br/><br/>`true` - Station is installed on the street.<br/>`false` - Station is not installed on the street.<br/><br/>Boolean SHOULD be set to `true` when equipment is present on the street. In seasonal systems where equipment is removed during winter, boolean SHOULD be set to `false` during the off season. May also be set to false to indicate planned (future) stations which have not yet been installed.
\-&nbsp;`is_renting` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station currently renting vehicles? <br /><br />`true` - Station is renting vehicles. Even if the station is empty, if it would otherwise allow rentals, this value MUST be `true`.<br/>`false` - Station is not renting vehicles.<br/><br/>If the station is temporarily taken out of service and not allowing rentals, this field MUST be set to `false`.<br/><br/>If a station becomes inaccessible to users due to road construction or other factors this field SHOULD be set to `false`. Field SHOULD be set to `false` during hours or days when the system is not offering vehicles for rent.
\-&nbsp;`is_returning` | Yes | Boolean | Is the station accepting vehicle returns? <br /><br />`true` - Station is accepting vehicle returns. Even if the station is full, if it would otherwise allow vehicle returns, this value MUST be `true`.<br /> `false` - Station is not accepting vehicle returns.<br/><br/>If the station is temporarily taken out of service and not allowing vehicle returns, this field MUST be set to `false`.<br/><br/>If a station becomes inaccessible to users due to road construction or other factors, this field SHOULD be set to `false`.
\-&nbsp;`last_reported` | Yes | Timestamp | The last time this station reported its status to the operator's backend.

##### Example 2:

This example demonstrates a pricing scheme that has a rate both by minute and by km. The user is charged $0.25 per km as well as $0.50 per minute. Both of these rates happen concurrently and are not dependent on one another.

### system_alerts.json

This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system_calendar.json feed.<br />
Obsolete alerts SHOULD be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`alerts` | Yes | Array | Array of objects each indicating a system alert as defined below.
\-&nbsp;`alert_id` | Yes | ID | Identifier for this alert.
\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | Enum | Valid values are:<br /><br /><ul><li>`system_closure`</li><li>`station_closure`</li><li>`station_move`</li><li>`other`</li></ul>
\-&nbsp;`times` | OPTIONAL | Array | Array of objects with the fields `start` and `end` indicating when the alert is in effect (e.g. when the system or station is actually closed, or when it is scheduled to be moved).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`start` | Yes | Timestamp | Start time of the alert.
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`end` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | End time of the alert. If there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this can be omitted.
\-&nbsp;`station_ids` | OPTIONAL | Array | If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ID(s). Otherwise omit this field. If both `station_id` and `region_id` are omitted, this alert affects the entire system.
\-&nbsp;`region_ids` | OPTIONAL | Array | If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ID(s). Otherwise, omit this field. If both `station_id`s and `region_id`s are omitted, this alert affects the entire system.
\-&nbsp;`url` | OPTIONAL | URL | URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert.
\-&nbsp;`summary` | Yes | String | A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer.
\-&nbsp;`description` | OPTIONAL | String | Detailed description of the alert.
\-&nbsp;`last_updated` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | Indicates the last time the info for the alert was updated.

### geofencing_zones.json *(added in v2.1)*

Describes geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes.<br />
Geofenced areas are delineated using GeoJSON in accordance with [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946). By default, no restrictions apply everywhere. Geofencing zones SHOULD be modeled according to restrictions rather than allowance. An operational area (outside of which vehicles cannot be used) SHOULD be defined with a counterclockwise polygon, and a limitation area (in which vehicles can be used under certain restrictions) SHOULD be defined with a clockwise polygon.<br><br>Geofences and GPS operate in two dimensions. Restrictions placed on an overpass or bridge will also  be applied to the roadway or path beneath.<br><br>Care SHOULD be taken when developing geofence based policies that rely on location data.  Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater.  This may result in vehicles being placed within a geofenced zone when they are actually outside or adjacent to the zone. Transit time between server and client can also impact when a user is notified of a geofence based policy. A vehicle traveling at 15kph can be well inside of a restricted zone before a notification is received.

Field Name | REQUIRED | Type | Defines
---|---|---|---
`geofencing_zones` | Yes | GeoJSON FeatureCollection | Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows.
\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | String | “FeatureCollection” (as per IETF [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3)).
\-&nbsp;`features` | Yes | Array | Array of objects as defined below.
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`type` | Yes | String | “Feature” (as per IETF [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3)).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`geometry` | Yes | GeoJSON Multipolygon | A polygon that describes where rides might not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations. A clockwise arrangement of points defines the area enclosed by the polygon, while a counterclockwise order defines the area outside the polygon ([right-hand rule](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.6)). All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (i.e., can be shown on a map for public use).
&emsp;\-&nbsp;`properties` | Yes | Object | Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`name` | OPTIONAL | String | Public name of the geofencing zone.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`start` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`end` | OPTIONAL | Timestamp | End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted.
&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`rules` | OPTIONAL | Array | Array that contains one object per rule as defined below. <br /><br /> In the event of colliding rules within the same polygon, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence. <br> In the case of overlapping polygons, the combined set of rules associated with the overlapping polygons applies to the union of the polygons. In the event of colliding rules in this set, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) also takes precedence.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`vehicle_type_id` | OPTIONAL | Array | Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in [PR #136](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pull/136)). If vehicle_type_ids are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`ride_allowed` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Boolean | REQUIRED if `rules` array is defined. Is the undocked (“free bike”) ride allowed to start and end in this zone? <br /><br /> `true` - Undocked (“free bike”) ride can start and end in this zone. <br /> `false` - Undocked (“free bike”) ride cannot start and end in this zone.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`ride_through_allowed` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Boolean | REQUIRED if `rules` array is defined. Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? <br /><br /> `true` - Ride can travel through this zone. <br /> `false` - Ride cannot travel through this zone.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\-&nbsp;`maximum_speed_kph` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative Integer | What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? <br /><br /> If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.

## Deep Links *(added in v1.1)*

Deep links to iOS, Android, and web apps are supported via URIs in the `system_information.json`, `station_information.json`, and `free_bike_status.json` files. The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples. For further examples, see ["What's New in GBFS"](https://medium.com/@mobilitydata/whats-new-in-gbfs-v2-0-63eb46e6bdc4).

### Analytics *(added in v1.1)*

In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link to request to a rental app by appending the `client_id` *(added in v1.1)* parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app.

For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append:

`client_id=google.com`

...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is:

`com.example.android://open.example.app/stations?id=1234567890`

...then the URI used by Google would be: `com.example.android://open.example.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com`

Other supported parameters include:

1. `ad_id` *(added in v1.1)* - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (e.g., IFDA on iOS)
2. `token` *(added in v1.1)* - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app.

#### Examples *(added in v1.1)*

##### Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported:

##### *system_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0",
  "data": {
    "name": "Example Bike Rental",
    "system_id": "example_cityname",
    "timezone": "US/Central",
    "language": "en",
    "rental_apps": {
      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.android://"
      },
      "ios": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.ios://"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### *station_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0",
  "data": {
    "stations": [
      {
        "station_id": "425",
        "name": "Coppertail",
        "lat": 27.956333,
        "lon": -82.430436,
        "rental_uris": {
          "android": "https://www.example.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android",
          "ios": "https://www.example.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that the Android URI and iOS Universal Link URLs don’t necessarily use the same identifier as the station_id.

##### Example 2 - App Links are not supported on Android and Universal Links are not supported on iOS, but deep links are still supported on Android and iOS:

##### *system_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0",
  "data": {
    "name": "Example Bike Rental",
    "system_id": "example_cityname",
    "timezone": "US/Central",
    "language": "en",
    "rental_apps": {
      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.android://"
        "store_uri": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.android",
      },
      "ios": {
        "store_uri": "https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id123456789",
        "discovery_uri": "com.example.ios://"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### *station_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0",
  "data": {
    "stations": [
      {
        "station_id": "425",
        "name": "Coppertail",
        "lat": 27.956333,
        "lon": -82.430436,
        "rental_uris":{
          "android":"com.example.android://open.example.app/app?sid=1234567890",
          "ios":"com.example.ios://open.example.app/app?sid=1234567890"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Example 3 - Deep link web URLs are supported, but not Android or iOS native apps:

##### *station_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 60,
  "version": "3.0",
  "data": {
    "stations": [
      {
        "station_id": "425",
        "name": "Coppertail",
        "lat": 27.956333,
        "lon": -82.430436,
        "rental_uris": {
          "web": "https://www.example.com/app?sid=1234567890"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
