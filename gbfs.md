## Introduction
This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

* Provide the status of the system at this moment
* Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

The specification supports real-time travel advice in GBFS-consuming applications.

## Version Endpoints
The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the `version` field in all files. See [Output Format](#output-format).<br />

GBFS Best Practice defines that:<br />

_GBFS producers_ should provide endpoints that conform to both the current specification long term support (LTS) branch as well as the latest release branch within at least 3 months of a new spec _MAJOR_ or _MINOR_ version release. It is not necessary to support more than one _MINOR_ release of the same _MAJOR_ release group because _MINOR_ releases are backwards-compatible. See [specification versioning](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#specification-versioning)<br />

_GBFS consumers_ should, at a minumum, support the current LTS branch. It highly recommended that GBFS consumers support later releases.<br />

Default GBFS feed URLs, e.g. `https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json` or `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json` must direct consumers to the feed that conforms to the current LTS documentation branch.


## Term Definitions
This section defines terms that are used throughout this document.

* JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp)
* Field - In JSON, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp)
* GeoJSON - GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. (https://geojson.org/)
* Required - The field must be included in the dataset, and a value must be provided in that field for each record.
* Optional - The field may be omitted from the dataset. If an optional column is included, some of the entries in that field may be empty strings. An omitted field is equivalent to a field that is empty.
* Conditionally required - The field or file is required under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is optional.

## Files
File Name | Required | Defines
---|---|---
gbfs.json | Yes <br/>*(as of v2.0-RC)* | Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system.
gbfs_versions.json <br/>*(added in v1.1-RC)* | Optional | Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation.
system_information.json | Yes | Details including system operator, system location, year implemented, URL, contact info, time zone.
station_information.json | Conditionally required | List of all stations, their capacities and locations. Required of systems utilizing docks.
station_status.json | Conditionally required | Number of available bikes and docks at each station and station availability. Required of systems utilizing docks.
free_bike_status.json | Conditionally required | Bikes that are available for rent. Required of systems that offer bikes for rent outside of stations.
system_hours.json | Optional | Hours of operation for the system.
system_calendar.json | Optional | Dates of operation for the system.
system_regions.json | Optional | Regions the system is broken up into.
system_pricing_plans.json | Optional | System pricing scheme.
system_alerts.json | Optional | Current system alerts.

## File Requirements
* All files should be valid JSON
* All files in the spec may be published at a URL path or with an alternate name (e.g., `station_info` instead of `station_information.json`) *(as of v2.0-RC)*.
* All data should be UTF-8 encoded
* Line breaks should be represented by unix newline characters only (\n)
* Pagination is not supported.

### File Distribution
* If the publisher intends to distribute as individual HTTP endpoints then:
    * Required files must not 404. They should return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in [Output Format](#output-format).
    * Optional files may 404. A 404 of an optional file should not be considered an error.
* Auto-Discovery:
    * This specification supports auto-discovery.
    * The location of the auto-discovery file will be provided in the HTML area of the shared mobility landing page hosted at the URL specified in the URL field of the system_infomation.json file.
    * This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
      * `<link rel="gbfs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json" />`
    * References:
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used

### Localization
* Each set of data files should be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json.
* A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages should do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as:
    * `https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json`
    * `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json`

## Field Types

* Array - A JSON element consisting of an ordered sequence of zero or more values.
* Object - A JSON element consisting of key-value pairs (fields).
* Boolean - One of two possible values, `true`or `false`. Boolean values must be JSON booleans, not strings (i.e. `true` or `false`, not `"true"` or `"false"`). *(as of v2.0-RC)*
* Date - Service day in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Example: `2019-09-13` for September 13th, 2019.
* Email - An email address. Example: `example@example.com`
* Enum (Enumerable values) - An option from a set of predefined constants in the "Defines" column.
Example: The `rental_methods` field contains values `CREDITCARD`, `PAYPASS`, etc...
* Timestamp - Timestamp fields must be represented as integers in POSIX time. (e.g., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC)
* ID - Should be represented as a string that identifies that particular entity. An ID:
	* must be unique within like fields (e.g. `station_id` must be unique among stations)
	* does not have to be globally unique, unless otherwise specified
	* must not contain spaces
	* should be persistent for a given entity (station, plan, etc). An exception is floating bike `bike_id`, which should not be persistent for privacy reasons (see `free_bike_status.json`). *(as of v2.0-RC)*
* String - Can only contain text. Strings must not contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines.
* Language - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt and http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/.
Examples: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English, or `de` for German.
* Latitude - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0.
Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.
* Longitude - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0.
Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.
* Non-negative Integer - An integer greater than or equal to 0.
* Non-negative Float - A floating point number greater than or equal to 0.
* Timezone - TZ timezone from the https://www.iana.org/time-zones. Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones for a list of valid values.
Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.
* URI *(added in v1.1-RC)* - A fully qualified URI that includes the scheme (e.g., `com.abcrental.android://`), and any special characters in the URI must be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URI values. Note that URIs may be URLs.
* URL - A fully qualified URL that includes `http://` or `https://`, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.

The deep link should take users directly to this station, without any prompts, interstitial pages, or logins. Make sure that users can see this station even if they never previously opened the application.  <br><br>If this field is empty, it means deep linking isn’t supported in the native iOS rental app. <br><br>Note that the URI does not necessarily include the station_id - other identifiers can be used by the rental app within the URL to uniquely identify this station. <br><br>See the [Analytics](#Analytics) section for how viewing apps can report the origin of the deep link to rental apps. <br><br>iOS Universal Links example value: `https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios` <br><br>Deep Link (without Universal Links) example value: `com.abcrental.ios://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890`

## Deep Links *(added in v1.1-RC)*

Deep links to iOS, Android, and web apps are supported via URIs in the `system_information.json`, `station_information.json`, and `free_bike_status.json` files. The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples.

### Analytics *(added in v1.1-RC)*

In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link to request to a rental app by appending the `client_id` *(added in v1.1-RC)* parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app.

For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append:

`client_id=google.com`

...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is:

`com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890`

...then the URI used by Google would be: `com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com`

Other supported parameters include:

1. `ad_id` *(added in v1.1-RC)* - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (e.g., IFDA on iOS)
2. `token` *(added in v1.1-RC)* - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app.

### Examples *(added in v1.1-RC)*

#### Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported:

*system_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "data": {
  "system_id": "abc_cityname",
  "short_name": "ABC Bike Rental",
  "rental_apps": {
    "android": {
      "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.android://"
    },
    "ios": {
      "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.ios://"
    }
  }
  ...
```

*station_information.json*

```jsonc
"stations": [
  {
    "station_id": "425",
    "name": "Coppertail",
    "lat": 27.9563335328521,
    "lon": -82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "android": "https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android",
      "ios": "https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios"
    }
  },
  ...
```


Note that the Android URI and iOS Universal Link URLs don’t necessarily use the same identifier as the station_id.


#### Example 2 - App Links are not supported on Android and Universal Links are not supported on iOS, but deep links are still supported on Android and iOS:

*system_information.json*

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1572447999,
  "data": {
    "system_id": "abc_cityname",
    "short_name": "ABC Bike Rental",
    "rental_apps": {
      "android": {
        "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.android://"
        "store_uri": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abcrental.android",
      },
      "ios": {
        "store_uri": "https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id123456789",
        "discovery_uri": "com.abcrental.ios://"
      }
    },
    ...
```

*station_information.json*

```jsonc
"stations": [
  {
    "station_id": "425",
    "name": "Coppertail",
    "lat": 27.9563335328521,
    "lon": -82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "android": "com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890",
      "ios": "com.abcrental.ios://open.abc.app/app?sid=1234567890"
    }
  },
  ...
```

#### Example 3 - Deep link web URLs are supported, but not Android or iOS native apps:

*station_information.json*

```jsonc
"stations": [
  {
    "station_id":"425",
    "name":"Coppertail",
    "lat":27.9563335328521,
    "lon":-82.430436084371,
    "rental_uris": {
      "web":"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890",
    }
  },
  ...
```
