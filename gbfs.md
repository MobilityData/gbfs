# General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)
This document explains the types of files and data that comprise the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) and defines the fields used in all of those files.

This branch and associated pull request is to discuss (a proposal)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5Muz_yJpwy-_zlfPPtMkpofZxV72zM09wV_h8eXIJ8] to add support for pricing models and price estimation.

## Introduction
This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind:

* Provide the status of the system at this moment
* Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical

Historical data, including station details and ride data is to be provided by a more compact specification designed specifically for such archival purposes. The data in the specification contained in this document is intended for consumption by clients intending to provide real-time (or semi-real-time) transit advice and is designed as such.

## Files
This specification defines the following files along with their associated content:

File Name                   | Required                |       Defines
--------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------
gbfs.json                   | Optional                | Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system. This file is optional, but highly recommended.
system_information.json     | Yes                     | Describes the system including System operator, System location, year implemented, URLs, contact info, time zone
station_information.json    | Conditionally required  | Mostly static list of all stations, their capacities and locations. Required of systems utilizing docks.
station_status.json         | Conditionally required  | Number of available bikes and docks at each station and station availability. Required of systems utilizing docks.
free_bike_status.json       | Conditionally required  | Describes bikes that are available for rent. Required of systems that don't utilize docks or offer bikes for rent outside of stations.
system_hours.json           | Optional                | Describes the hours of operation for the system
system_calendar.json        | Optional                | Describes the days of operation for the system
system_regions.json         | Optional                | Describes the regions the system is broken up into
system_pricing_plans.json   | Optional                | Describes the system pricing
system_alerts.json          | Optional                | Describes current system alerts

## File Requirements
* All files should be valid JSON
* All data should be UTF-8 encoded
* Line breaks should be represented by unix newline characters only (\n)

### File Distribution
* This specification does not dictate the implementation details around the distribution of the JSON data files
* If the publisher intends to distribute as individual HTTP endpoints then:
    * Required files must not 404 - they should return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in Output Format
    * Optional files may 404 - a 404 of an optional file should not be considered an error, it just indicates that the publisher has chosen not to publish this data
* Auto-Discovery:
    * This specification supports auto-discovery
    * The location of the auto-discovery file will be provided in the HTML <head> area of the bikeshare landing page hosted at the URL specified in the url field of the system_infomation.json file
    * This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
      * `<link rel="gbfs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json" />`
    * Reference:
      * https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices#tags
      * https://dev.twitter.com/cards/markup
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
      * http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used

### Localization

* Each set of data files should be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json
* A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages should do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as
    * https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json
    * https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json

## Field Definitions

* Time stamp fields must be represented as integers in POSIX time (i.e., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC)
* ID fields in the document should be represented as strings that identify that particular object. They:
    * must be unique within like fields (bike_id must be unique among bikes)
    * do not have to be globally unique
    * must not contain spaces
    * should be persistent for a given object (station, plan, etc)
* Text fields can only contain text - they must not contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines
* Enumerable values should be expected to change over time. Values will not be removed, but new valid values may be added as business requirements change and consumers should be designed to handle these changes

### Output Format
Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object:

Field Name          | Required  | Defines

Vendors who do not want to publicize the number of disabled bikes or docks in their system can opt to omit station capacity (in station_information), num_bikes_disabled and num_docks_disabled. If station capacity is published then broken docks/bikes can be inferred (though not specifically whether the decreased capacity is a broken bike or dock)
\- num_docks_available | Yes       | Number of docks accepting bike returns
\- num_docks_disabled  | Optional  | Number of empty but disabled dock points at the station. This value remains as part of the spec as it is possibly useful during development

\- name           | Yes       | Public name for this region

### system_pricing_plans.json
Describe pricing for the system. This scheme does not currently factor in lost bike fees as it seems outside of the scope of this specification, but they could be added. It is an array of pricing objects defined as follows:

Field Name        | Required  | Defines
------------------| --------- | ----------
plans             | Yes       | Array of any number of plan objects as defined below:

\- description     | Yes       | Text field describing the particular pricing plan in human readable terms.  This should include the duration, price, conditions, etc. that the publisher would like users to see. This is intended to be a human-readable description and should not be used for automatic calculations

### system_alerts.json
This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system_calendar.json feed.

This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. The consumer could use the start/end information to determine if this is a past, ongoing or future alert and adjust the presentation accordingly.

Field Name        | Required    | Defines
----------------- | ------------| ----------
alerts            | Yes         | Array - alert objects each indicating a separate system alert as defined below

\- times           | Optional    | Array of hashes with the keys "start" and "end" indicating when the alert is in effect (e.g. when the system or station is actually closed, or when it is scheduled to be moved). If this array is omitted then the alert should be displayed as long as it is in the feed.
&emsp;- start     | Yes         | Integer POSIX timestamp - required if container "times" key is present
&emsp;- end       | Optional    | Integer POSIX timestamp - if there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this key can be omitted indicating that there is no currently scheduled end time for the alert
\- station_ids     | Optional    | Array of strings - If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ids, otherwise omit this field. If both station_ids and region_ids are omitted, assume this alert affects the entire system
\- region_ids      | Optional    | Array of strings - If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ids, otherwise, omit this field. If both station_ids and region_ids are omitted, assume this alert affects the entire system
\- url             | Optional    | String - URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert, if there is one
\- summary         | Yes         | String - A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer
\- description     | Optional    | String - Detailed text description of the alert
\- last_updated    | Optional    | Integer POSIX timestamp indicating the last time the info for the particular alert was updated

## Possible Future Enhancements
There are some items that were proposed in an earlier version of this document but which do not fit into the current specification. They are collected here for reference and for possible discussion and inclusion in this or a future version.

* system_information.json
    * _system_data_ - Removed due to a lack of specificity; if metadata about the location of URLs is required / desired, the proposal is to include this in a separate feed_info.json feed which would contain an array with all of the feeds in addition to other feed information such as a feed version (if necessary)
    * _equipment_ - Removed due to a lack of specificity behind the intent of this field and a question about the actual relevance to the public
    * _jurisdictions_ - It is believed that the need for this field is negated by the presence of the system_regions.json feed

* station_status.json
    * need a way to distinguish between multiple bike types at a station if/when  hybrid systems using e-bikes become available
